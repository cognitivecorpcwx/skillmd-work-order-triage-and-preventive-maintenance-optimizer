# SKILL.md: Work Order Triage and Preventive Maintenance Optimizer

## Overview

The **Work Order Triage and Preventive Maintenance Optimizer** is designed to transform unstructured, reactive maintenance efforts into a streamlined, proactive process. This guide provides instructions on utilizing structured data and prioritization metrics to ensure consistent execution and measurable outcomes.

## Objective

The main goal of this skill is to implement a system that categorizes work orders efficiently, prioritizing them based on urgency, impact, and resource availability. Ultimately, this helps in minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity. 

## O*NET Skills Utilized

To facilitate process optimization, we draw from the following O*NET skills:

1. **Critical Thinking**: Evaluating the pros and cons of possible solutions to problems in maintenance.
2. **Active Listening**: Understanding the needs and feedback of workers concerning equipment and maintenance schedules.
3. **Coordination**: Adjusting actions in relation to others' actions, ensuring all maintenance tasks are harmonized.
4. **Complex Problem Solving**: Identifying complex issues in work orders and finding solutions that integrate preventive measures.
5. **Judgment and Decision Making**: Making informed decisions by assessing situations based on structured data and metrics.

## Instructions for Use

### 1. Data Input

Start by collecting structured data on work orders and maintenance requests. This data may include:

- Equipment type
- Historical downtime and failure rates
- Urgency of the request (e.g., production impact)
- Resource availability (personnel, tools, parts)

### 2. Establish Prioritization Metrics

Define a scoring system to evaluate work orders. Consider factors such as:

- **Severity of Impact**: How critical is the task to operations?
- **Likelihood of Failure**: Based on historical data, what is the chance this equipment will fail?
- **Resource Allocation**: Are the necessary resources available, or will postponing the work order be more beneficial?
  
Create a matrix that assigns weights to each factor, aggregating scores to rank work orders.

### 3. Triage Workflow

Utilize the following triage workflow to categorize work orders:

- **Routine Maintenance**: Preventive tasks scheduled based on time intervals or usage rates.
- **Urgent Work Orders**: Critical issues that require immediate attention (e.g., equipment failure).
- **Scheduled Work Orders**: Non-critical tasks that can be deferred to a later date.

### 4. Implementation

Once work orders are categorized and scored, the next steps include:

- **Communicate Priorities**: Share the prioritized list with maintenance teams, ensuring everyone understands which tasks require immediate attention.
- **Monitor Execution**: Use software tools to track progress on work orders and update their status in real-time.
- **Evaluate Outcomes**: Measure the effectiveness of the triage system by assessing maintenance metrics such as mean time to repair (MTTR), equipment availability, and workforce productivity.

### 5. Continuous Improvement

Regularly review the prioritization metrics and workflow effectiveness. Solicit feedback from maintenance personnel and adjust your approach based on insights gained and new data trends.

## Conclusion

By leveraging structured data and prioritization metrics through the **Work Order Triage and Preventive Maintenance Optimizer**, organizations can achieve consistency in maintenance execution and foster a proactive culture. Embrace these instructions for streamlining processes and enhancing operational efficiency within your facility.
